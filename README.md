## Dataiku Cloud Optimizer Agent

This project provides a Dataiku-driven agent to optimize multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) and Databricks workloads. It ingests cloud costs, analyzes Databricks job history, and recommends right-sized clusters and policies. Includes a FastAPI endpoint and a minimal Dataiku webapp for interactive recommendations.
